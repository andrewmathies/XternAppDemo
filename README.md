# XternAppDemo
I made this for my Xtern summer 2017 application. Users can register with a username and password which will be saved in a binary file along with their current balance. Users gain "coins" by randomly guessing a number between 1 and 100. You can also press a button which will simulate guessing.
If for some godforsaken reason you actually download the jar and run it, don't press the simulate guess button. If you do, you have to press enter or click a button every time a guess is made to exit an alert that pops up. In addition, there is no time between when the alert is exited and the next guess is made so you can only exit the application by going into task manager and manually killing the JVM process.
